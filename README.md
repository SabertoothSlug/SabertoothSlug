### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### âš¡ About Me âš¡


I'm a fullstack web developer with a mechanical engineering background. After graduating college, I grew my passion for design while working as a head brewer in the craft beer industry and as a lead solar technician in the renewables industry. I enjoy working with others and meeting new challenges with creative solutions. If you have a project you need help with or want to start something new, I'd love to contribute where I can. Just drop me a line.

/*I have a passion for design that I've been developing for years in various industries. Between my Mechanical Engineering, Beer Brewing, and Solar Repair careers, I have been exposed to multiple technical environments and grown as an engineer. These environments share a common thread of problem-solving that has led me to software development. Designing code is a distilled form of problem-solving that opens up a fascinating world of potential. I work hard to contribute to that potential and am excited by the challenges that come next.*/

In my free time, I like to go fast on motorcycles that I fix, play music, and explore new board games.
