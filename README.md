### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### âš¡ About Me âš¡

I have a passion for design that I've been developing for years in various industries. Between my Mechanical Engineering, Beer Brewing, and Solar Repair careers, I have been exposed to multiple technical environments and grown as an engineer. These environments share a common thread of problem-solving that has led me to software development. Designing code is a distilled form of problem-solving that opens up a fascinating world of potential. I work hard to contribute to that potential and am excited by the challenges that come next.

In my free time, I like to go fast on motorcycles that I fix, play music, and explore new board games.
